# Census example

Download, clean up and map data from the U.S. Census Bureau using TablesShaper and [mapshaper](https://mapshaper.org/).

The map shows the percent of county population that's foreign born.

To run the example make sure you've got TableShaper and mapshaper both installed. Then run `bash create-map.sh`.
